# rf-api

* unstable - do not use now
* will be the common part for every rapidfacture app

The API reduces bad code practices:

- very long code
- forgotten error handling
- nonuniform error messages (dependent on developer)
- linearize asynchron code
 
 The answer function has following methods:
 - _response
 - _request
 - _session
 - reqUrl
 - send
 - sendDocsRequired
 - error
 - errorCustom
 - ObjectId
 
 Further functions can be added as plugings
